Members of the Galician research group — **Carolina**, **Constanza**, **Marta**, and **César** — recently traveled to **Barcelona** to visit **BCN MedTech (Universitat Pompeu Fabra)** and **BCNatal (Hospital Clínic & Sant Joan de Déu)** as part of their ongoing collaboration in fetal development and AI-based medical imaging research.

The visit aimed to strengthen interdisciplinary collaboration and discuss recent progress in the group’s research on **machine learning models for early detection of fetal growth alterations**.  

During the meetings, the team:
- Shared preliminary results on integrating **longitudinal ultrasound data** and **maternal clinical parameters** for gestational age estimation and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) detection.  
- Visited BCNatal to better understand the **clinical workflow** of fetal ultrasound analysis and explore ways to facilitate model deployment in real-world settings.  

This exchange provided valuable clinical and technical feedback that will guide the next phase of model validation and development. The collaboration between the Galician team, BCN MedTech, and BCNatal highlights the importance of combining **clinical expertise and AI methodologies** to improve prenatal care.
