The MLAS Summer School, organized by the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid, brought together researchers and students from around the world to explore recent advances in **machine learning**, **artificial intelligence**, and **advanced statistics**.  

During the event, Carolina and Constanza attended lectures on:
- Causality 
- Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization  
- Explainable Machine Learning  
- Generative AI 

We are proud of their involvement and look forward to seeing how the knowledge gained at MLAS 2025 enhances their ongoing research on **machine learning models informed by clinical data for fetal development analysis**.
